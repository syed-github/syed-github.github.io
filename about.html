				<h2><u>About the narrative visualisation on deaths due to drug poisoning in five US states from 2011 to 2016</u></h2>
				<p></p>
				<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>

				The visualization followed the 'Interactive Slideshow' hybrid narrative structure. It is a very simple visualization. The author-driven content is in the main page where a simple bubble chart shows the comparison of number of deaths in five US states due to drug poisoning, and total numbers on the top of each bubble or circle. The states are Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia respectively. More author driven contents are in the charts inside the slides or pages of each state which shows the years through x-axis and number of deaths through the y-axis, and the exact number of deaths is displayed on the bar for each year. Now comes the reader-driven content. Reader can check the main page to understand the message, and if it seems interesting then the user can navigate through the other slides or scenes or pages. When user moves to a page of a particular state, say 'Connecticut' is the state, then user can see the bars representing the number of deaths over a particular year in Connecticut. Furthermore, when hovering over the bars, user can read through the displayed tooltip where population of the state at that year will be visible.

				<p><b>Scenes:</b><br>
				There are a total 6 scenes in this visualization. Each of the pages including the main page can be considered as a scene.<br>
				<ul type="disc">
